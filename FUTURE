FUTURE PLANS (Roadmap)

Let me know what is important to you!

Read wadl file from bluecat server, and use it to:
- take arguments without the names
- figure out the http method automatically
- Handle start and count automatically
Together, instead of:
 ./bam.py getEntities method=get parentId=13098279 type=HostRecord start=0 count=99999
Just type:
 ./bam.py getEntities 13098279 HostRecord

Option to save and reuse the login token across multiple calls
More automated tests
More error checking and more specific error messages
More debug options
Read text or json input from stdin and use the appropriate values as argument "-"
like:
bam.py getEntityByName 0 'Main' Configuration | bam.py getEntityByName - 'Default' View

Config file for server, user, and password
Get defaults for Configuration and View from config file

Recognize IP and MAC Addresses in various formats
Allow arguments that are id's to optionally be names, and convert automatically
Select what fields to output, instead of whole objects, if desired

Add common tasks that map to several API calls, like getting a DNS record by FQDN

Sort dictionary items, either alphabetically,
or in an order that makes sense for BlueCat entities.
