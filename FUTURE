FUTURE PLANS (Roadmap)

Let me know what is important to you!

Read wadl file from bluecat server, and use it to:
- take arguments without the names
- figure out the http method automatically (partly done)
- Handle start and count automatically
Together, instead of:
 ./bam.py getEntities method=get parentId=13098279 type=HostRecord start=0 count=99999
Just type:
 ./bam.py getEntities 13098279 HostRecord

Option to save and reuse the login token across multiple calls
Unit tests
More error checking and more specific error messages
More debug options
Read text or json input from stdin and use the appropriate values as argument "-"
like:
bam.py getEntityByName 0 'Main' Configuration | bam.py getEntityByName - 'Default' View

Optional config file for server, user, and password (as an alternate to environment vars)

Recognize IP and MAC Addresses in various formats
Allow arguments that are id's to optionally be names, and convert automatically
Select what fields to output, instead of whole objects, if desired

Add common tasks that map to several API calls, like getting a DNS record by FQDN

Sort dictionary items so that output is in a consistent order,
either alphabetically, or in an order that makes sense for BlueCat entities.

Technical improvements:
Convert from Gitlab to Github
Publish to pypi.org
Update the sample scripts to the latest format that I have evolved to.
Rearrange the file structure
Split up the api.py file
Allow use without even having to install
